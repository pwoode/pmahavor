## Phebe Mawuena Afi Havor - PhD Candidate

Welcome to my academic website! My name is Phebe Havor and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Scientific Computing and Industrial Modelling at the Kwame Nkrumah Unviversity of Science and Technology, Ghana. By trade, I consider myself to be a mathematical and computational biologist, but I have experience in a variety of different fields. Feel free to explore my talks, publications, and other tabs to learn more about my research.

### About Me
My name is Salomon Kabongo KABENAMUALU. I'm currently a Student at the [African Master in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI), working toward an M.Sc in Machine Intelligence as sponsored by Facebook and Google. Before joining AMMI, I obtained my M.Sc in Mathematics from [The University of the Western Cape](https://www.uwc.ac.za/) in 2019 in affiliation with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences ([AIMS South Africa](https://aims.ac.za/)), during which I got introduced to the field of Machine Learning and worked on investigating propreties of words embeddings under the supervision of Prof. [Etienne Barbard](http://news.nwu.ac.za/experts/etienne-barnard). I also hold a B.Sc and honors degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Universit√© de Lubumbashi](http://www.unilu.ac.cd/).
