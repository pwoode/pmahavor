## Phebe Mawuena Afi Havor - PhD Candidate

Welcome to my academic website! My name is Phebe Havor and I am currently a PhD Candidate in Scientific Computing and Industrial Modelling at the Kwame Nkrumah Unviversity of Science and Technology, Ghana. By trade, I consider myself to be a mathematical and computational biologist, but I have experience in a variety of different fields. Feel free to explore my talks, publications, and other tabs to learn more about my research.




## Background
I received my B.S. in Biomathematics from Rhodes College in Memphis, TN, in 2015 under the advising of Erin Bodine. 
My love of research began in the fall of 2012 when I enrolled in a mathematical modeling course focusing on disease dynamics using ordinary differential equations. 
From there, I was doomed in the best way possible. The next summer I participated in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), which focused on the Santa Cruz Island fox and the potential reasons for its population decline in the 1990s. 
This resulted in a number of talks and two publications.

Following graduation, I immediately enrolled as a PhD student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology (EEB) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), advised by Dr. Louis J. Gross. 
At UTK, I am also pursuing a MS in Statistics through the Interdepartmental Graduate Statistics Program (IGSP) and have completed all necessary requirements for this degree. 
My dissertation uses mathematical and statistical models to observe and predict the epidemic spread of gun crime in Chicago, Illinois, with the goal of determining the optimal methods of reduction.
